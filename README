    python docstyle checker
    =======================

A tool for automaticaly checking for the formatting errors in 
python PyDocs as designed for usage in epydoc.

A basic example is:

def foo(bar, baz=None):
    '''
    This function does foo by bar and baz.

    @raise Exception: If we do something unexpected.

    @type  bar: str
    @param bar: Bar is used for doing foo.
    @type  baz: dict
    @param baz: Foo looks into baz (optional).
    
    @rtype:  str
    @return: Fooed baz.
    '''
    if type(baz) is not str:
        # Something unexpected.
        raise Exception('This was not expected.')
    return 'foo[%s]' % bar


This example shows what kind of notation is expected from the developer.
